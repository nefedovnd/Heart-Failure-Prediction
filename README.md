# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Project for Codecademy Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow Skill Path

In this project, I will use a dataset from Kaggle to predict the survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction, and other factors such as age, anemia, diabetes, and so on.

This project is a part of Codecademy Deep Learning course.
